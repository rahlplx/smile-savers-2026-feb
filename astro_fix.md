Even if the fix attempt fails, you encounter errors, or you cannot resolve the bug — always update `report.md` with your findings. The orchestrator and downstream skills depend on this file to determine what happened.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThese variables are referenced throughout this skill. They may be passed as args by an orchestrator, or inferred from the conversation when run standalone.\n\n- **`triageDir`** — Directory containing the reproduction project (e.g. `triage/issue-123`). If not passed as an arg, infer from previous conversation.\n- **`issueDetails`** - The GitHub API issue details payload. This must be provided explicitly by the user or available from prior conversation context / tool calls. If this data isn't available, you may run `gh issue view ${issue_number}` to load the missing issue details directly from GitHub.\n- **`report.md`** — File in `triageDir` that MAY exist. Contains the full context from all previous skills.\n- **Astro Compiler source** — The `withastro/compiler` repo MAY be cloned at `.compiler/` (inside the repo root, gitignored). If it exists and the root cause is in the compiler, investigate and propose fixes there. This clone is **reference only** — it is not wired into the monorepo's dependencies, so compiler changes cannot be tested end-to-end here. Document proposed compiler changes and diff in `report.md` instead.\n\n## Overview\n\n1. Review the diagnosis from `report.md`\n2. Verify fix feasibility (browser/runtime compatibility)\n3. Implement a minimal fix in `packages/`\n4. Rebuild the affected package(s)\n5. Verify the fix resolves the reproduction\n6. Ensure no regressions\n7. Generate git diff\n8. Append fix details to `report.md`\n9. Clean up the working directory\n\n## Step 1: Review the Diagnosis\n\nRead `report.md` from the `triageDir` directory to understand:\n\n- The root cause and affected files\n- The suggested approach\n- Any edge cases to consider\n\n**Skip if prerequisites unmet:** Check `report.md`: If bug not reproduced/skipped OR diagnosis confidence is `low`/`null` OR no root cause found → append \"FIX SKIPPED: [reason]\" to `report.md` and return `fixed: false`.\n\n**Note:** The repo may be messy from previous steps. Check `git status` and either work from the current state or `git reset --hard` to start clean.\n\n## Step 2: Verify Fix Feasibility\n\nConsider your potential fixes and verify that any modern features you plan to use are supported:\n\n- **Node.js:** When writing code for the runtime (server, build logic, integrations, etc.), target Node.js version `>=22.12.0`.\n- **Browsers:** If your fix relies on browser support for any web platform feature, check the browser compatibility table on MDN to confirm it is supported across our browser targets. Do not treat specification compliance as proof of browser support. If the feature lacks sufficient support, choose a different approach.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the Fix\n\nMake changes in `packages/` source files. Follow these principles:\n\n**Keep it minimal:**\n\n- Only change what's necessary to fix the bug\n- Don't refactor unrelated code\n- Don't add new features\n\n**Consider edge cases:**\n\n- Will this break other use cases?\n- What happens with unusual input?\n- Are there null/undefined checks needed?\n\nExample fix:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (in packages/astro/src/core/render/component.ts)\nexport function renderComponent(component: AstroComponent, props: Props) {\n  const html = renderToString(component, props);\n  return html;\n}\n\n// After\nexport function renderComponent(component: AstroComponent, props: Props) {\n  // Skip SSR for client:only components\n  if (props['client:only']) {\n    return `<astro-island client=\"only\" component-url=\"${component.url}\"></astro-island>`;\n  }\n  const html = renderToString(component, props);\n  return html;\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Rebuild the Package\n\nAfter making changes, rebuild the affected package:\n\n```bash\npnpm -C packages/astro build    # or packages/integrations/<name>\n```\n\nWatch for build errors — fix any TypeScript issues before proceeding.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the Fix\n\nRe-run the reproduction, often using `pnpm run build`/`astro build` or `pnpm run dev`/`astro dev`.\n\n## Step 6: Check for Regressions\n\nTest that you didn't break anything new, and that normal cases still work. If you find regressions, refine the fix to handle all cases.\n\n## Step 7: Generate Git Diff\n\nFrom the repository root, generate the diff:\n\n```bash\ngit diff packages/\n```\n\nThis captures all your changes for the report.\n\n## Step 8: Write Output\n\nAppend your fix details to the existing `report.md` (written by reproduce and diagnose skills).\n\nInclude a new section with: what you changed, why, the full git diff, verification results, and any tradeoffs or alternative approaches considered.\n\nThe report must include all information needed for a final GitHub comment to be generated later by the comment skill. Make sure to include:\n\n- What was changed and why\n- The full git diff (unless it is massive, if it is)\n- Whether the fix was successful or not\n- Verification results (did the fix resolve the original error?)\n- Any alternative approaches considered and their tradeoffs\n- If the fix failed: what was tried and why it didn't work\n\n## Step 9: Clean Up the Working Directory\n\n1. Run `git status` and review all changed files\n2. Revert any changes that are NOT part of the fix:\n   - Debug code, `console.log`s, or temporary test files\n   - Changes outside `packages/` that were only needed for diagnosis/reproduction\n   - Build artifacts that shouldn't be committed\n3. Use `git checkout -- <file>` to discard unwanted changes\n4. Confirm with a final `git status` that only the intended fix files remain\n5. DO NOT commit or push anything yet! The user will handle that at a later step.\n\nThe `triage/` directory is already gitignored, so it won't appear in `git status`.\n</pre></body></html>",
